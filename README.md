from UCSanDiegoX and [end.org](end.org)

This 10-week self-paced course is part of the Data Science MicroMasters program and will introduce you to a collection of powerful, open-source, tools needed to analyze data and to conduct data science. Specifically, you’ll learn how to use:

* Python
* Jupyter notebooks
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* git
* scikit-learn
* NLTK
* and many other tools!

You will learn these tools all within the context of solving compelling data science problems.
After completing this course, you’ll be able to find answers within large datasets by using python tools to import data, explore it, analyze it, learn from it, visualize it, and ultimately generate easily sharable reports. You'll also be introduced to Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing tools to expand your data analysis abilities (e.g., being able to analyze twitter data for user sentiments).

By learning these skills, you’ll also become a member of a world-wide community which seeks to build data science tools, explore public datasets, and discuss evidence-based findings. Last but not least, this course will provide you with the foundation you need to succeed in later courses in the Data Science MicroMasters program.
